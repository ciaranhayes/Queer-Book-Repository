# üìö The Queer Book Repository
The Queer Book Repository is a project I developed as part of my studies at Chas Academy. It builds on a RESTful API I previously created for managing queer-themed book entries and gives that backend a straightforward and functional frontend interface.

This project was primarily focused on creating a user-friendly way to interact with API routes for Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations. The frontend is intentionally simple to keep the focus on showcasing how the API can be utilized in a clean and efficient way.

## üöÄ Features

- Full CRUD support (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Fetches and displays books from a RESTful API
- Clean and minimal interface to interact with the backend
- Built with modern Typescript and frontend development practices

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, Typescript, JQuery
- Backend API: RESTful API (built previously with Express, Mongoose and MongoDB, not included in this repo)
- Package Manager: npm
